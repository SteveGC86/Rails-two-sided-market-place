### The Problem
Numerous people are not able to leave the house or people are too busy with their everyday lives to spend hours shopping for the weeks groceries.

### The Solution
Trundler is a platform that allows an individual to advertise their weekly grocery list and pay someone else to purchase and drop off the required groceries. Trundler connects people who need groceries with people who need work. Trundler has a chat feature that allows the shopper to contact the user if a given item is not available and allows the user to choose an alternative. The chat feature also allows the user to contact the shopper and adjust the drop off address and time.

### Design Process

### User stories

The User stories were fairly straight forward as I believe that a large number of the situations would be covered by the apps features. To possibly highlight some problems I created a couple of User workflow diagrams to show any possible problems that could arise.
